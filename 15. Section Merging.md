# Section Merging 节的合并

The **SHF_MERGE** section flag can be used to mark **SHT_PROGBITS** sections within relocatable objects. See [Figure 4-11: Section Attribute Flags](https://github.com/astrotycoon/Executable-And-Linking-Format-ELF/blob/main/12.%20Section%20Attribute%20Flags.md#figure-4-11-section-attribute-flags). This flag indicates that the section can be merged with compatible sections from other objects. Such merging has the potential to reduce the size of any dynamic object that is built from these relocatable objects. This size reduction can also have a positive effect on the runtime performance of the resulting object.

在可重定位文件中，可以给类型为**SHT_PROGBITS**的section设置属性标志**SHF_MERGE**（**SHF_MERGE**的描述见[Figure 4-11: Section Attribute Flags](https://github.com/astrotycoon/Executable-And-Linking-Format-ELF/blob/main/12.%20Section%20Attribute%20Flags.md#figure-4-11-section-attribute-flags)）。**SHF_MERGE**表明链接器可以将它与其它同样设置了**SHF_MERGE**标志的section合并。通过合并这样的section，可以有效地减小最终生成ELF文件的大小（最终生成的ELF文件可以是可执行文件，也可以是共享库文件）。而越小的ELF文件也越有利于运行时性能的提升。

A **SHF_MERGE** flagged section indicates that the section adheres to the following characteristics.

* The section is read-only. It must not be possible for a program containing this section to alter the section data at runtime.

* Every item in the section is accessed from an individual relocation record. The program code must not make any assumptions about the relative position of items in the section when generating the code that accesses the items.

* If the section also has the **SHF_STRINGS** flag set, then the section can only contain null terminated strings. Null characters are only allowed as string terminators, and null characters must not appear within the middle of any string.

**SHF_MERGE** is an optional flag indicating a possible optimization. The link-editor is allowed to perform the optimization, or to ignore the optimization. The link-editor creates a valid output object in either case. The link-editor currently implements section merging only for sections containing string data marked with the **SHF_STRINGS** flag.

When the **SHF_STRINGS** section flag is set in conjunction with the **SHF_MERGE** flag, the strings in the section are available to be merged with strings from other compatible sections. The link-editor merges such sections using the same string compression algorithm as used to compress the **SHT_STRTAB** string tables, ***.strtab*** and ***.dynstr***.

* Duplicate strings are reduced to a single copy.

* Tail strings are eliminated. For example, if input sections contain the strings "bigdog" and "dog", then the smaller "dog" string is eliminated, and the tail of the larger string is used to represent the smaller string.

The link-editor currently implements string merging only for strings that consist of byte sized characters that do not have special alignment constraints. Specifically, the following section characteristics are required.

* `sh_entsiz` must be **0**, or **1**. Sections containing wide characters are not supported.

* Only sections where `sh_addralign` is **0**, or a power of **2**, are merged.
