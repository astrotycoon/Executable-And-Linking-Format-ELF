# Section Merging 节合并

The **SHF_MERGE** section flag can be used to mark **SHT_PROGBITS** sections within relocatable objects. See Table 18, ELF Section Attribute Flags. This flag indicates that the section can be merged with compatible sections from other objects. Such merging has the potential to reduce the size of any dynamic object that is built from these relocatable objects. This size reduction can also have a positive effect on the runtime performance of the resulting object.
