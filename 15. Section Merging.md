# Section Merging 节合并

The **SHF_MERGE** section flag can be used to mark **SHT_PROGBITS** sections within relocatable objects. See [Figure 4-11: Section Attribute Flags](https://github.com/astrotycoon/Executable-And-Linking-Format-ELF/blob/main/12.%20Section%20Attribute%20Flags.md#figure-4-11-section-attribute-flags). This flag indicates that the section can be merged with compatible sections from other objects. Such merging has the potential to reduce the size of any dynamic object that is built from these relocatable objects. This size reduction can also have a positive effect on the runtime performance of the resulting object.

A **SHF_MERGE** flagged section indicates that the section adheres to the following characteristics.

* The section is read-only. It must not be possible for a program containing this section to alter the section data at runtime.

* Every item in the section is accessed from an individual relocation record. The program code must not make any assumptions about the relative position of items in the section when generating the code that accesses the items.

* If the section also has the **SHF_STRINGS** flag set, then the section can only contain null terminated strings. Null characters are only allowed as string terminators, and null characters must not appear within the middle of any string.
