# Data Encoding 数据编码方式

A file's data encoding specifies how to interpret the basic objects in a file. Class **ELFCLASS32** files use objects that occupy 1, 2, and 4 bytes. Class **ELFCLASS64** files use objects that occupy 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes. Under the defined encodings, objects are represented as shown below.

Encoding **ELFDATA2LSB** specifies 2's complement values, with the least significant byte occupying the lowest address.
