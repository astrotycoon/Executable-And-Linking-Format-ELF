# Section Groups

Some sections occur in interrelated groups. For example, an out-of-line definition of an inline function might require, in addition to the section containing its executable instructions, a read-only data section containing literals referenced, one or more debugging information sections and other informational sections. Furthermore, there may be internal references among these sections that would not make sense if one of the sections were removed or replaced by a duplicate from another object. Therefore, such groups must be included or omitted from the linked object as a unit. A section cannot be a member of more than one group.

有一些section彼此是有关联的，它们组成了一个组，被称为节组（section group）。



A section of type **SHT_GROUP** defines such a grouping of sections. The name of a symbol from one of the containing object's symbol tables provides a signature for the section group. The section header of the **SHT_GROUP** section specifies the identifying symbol entry, as described above: the `sh_link` member contains the section header index of the symbol table section that contains the entry. The sh_info member contains the symbol table index of the identifying entry. The `sh_flags` member of the section header contains **0**. The name of the section (`sh_name`) is not specified.
