# Extended Section Header

There are limitations on the number of sections that can be represented by standard ELF data structures.

The `e_shnum` and `e_shstrndx` elements of the ELF header are both limited to being able to represent **65535** sections.

In addition, symbol table entries can reference their associated section using the `st_shndx` element, which is limited to being able to represent **65279** sections. Although the size of this element could represent 65535 sections, a range of values is reserved for special symbol types, **SHN_LORESERVE** (0xff00) - **SHN_HIRESERVE** (0xffff).

To allow an ELF object to contain more than **65279** sections, a number of special definitions and a special section type are provided. The resultant ELF object is said to contain extended section header information.

In a standard ELF object, the first section header is zero filled. See Table 35, ELF Symbol Table Entry: Index 0. When the number of sections exceed the ELF header data sizes, elements of section header 0 are used to define extended ELF header attributes. The following table shows the values.
