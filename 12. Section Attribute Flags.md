# Section Attribute Flags

A section header's `sh_flags` member holds 1-bit flags that describe the section's attributes. Defined values appear in the following table; other values are reserved.

节头表表项中成员`sh_flags`用来描述节的各种属性。

`sh_flags`中一个bit对应该节的一个属性，当某种属性设置时，相应bit设置为1，反之设置为0。

**Name** | **Value** | **Meaning**
|:-|:-|:-|
SHF_WRITE            |0x1(1 << 0)    |Writable
SHF_ALLOC            |0x2(1 << 1)    |Occupies memory during execution
SHF_EXECINSTR        |0x4(1 << 2)    |Executable
SHF_MERGE            |0x10(1 << 4)    |Might be merged
SHF_STRINGS          |0x20(1 << 5)    |Contains nul-terminated strings
SHF_INFO_LINK        |0x40(1 << 6)    |`sh_info` contains SHT index
SHF_LINK_ORDER       |0x80(1 << 7)    |Preserve order after combining
SHF_OS_NONCONFORMING |0x100(1 << 8)    |Non-standard OS specific handling required
SHF_GROUP            |0x200(1 << 9)    |Section is member of a group.
SHF_TLS              |0x400(1 << 10)   |Section hold thread-local data.
SHF_COMPRESSED       |0x800(1 << 11)   |Section with compressed data.
SHF_MASKOS           |0x0ff00000 |OS-specific.
SHF_MASKPROC         |0xf0000000 |Processor-specific
SHF_ORDERED          |(1 << 30)  |Special ordering requirement (Solaris).
SHF_EXCLUDE          |(1U << 31) |Section is excluded unless referenced or allocated (Solaris).

If a flag bit is set in `sh_flag`s, the attribute is ``on'' for the section. Otherwise, the attribute is ``off'' or does not apply. Undefined attributes are set to zero.

当成员`sh_flags`的某个bit设置为1时，说明该section具备相应的属性。反之，则说明该section不具备相应的属性，或者说该属性根本就不适用该类型的文件。`sh_flags`中还有很多很多bit并未定义对应什么属性，这些bit设置为0。

### SHF_WRITE

The section contains data that should be writable during process execution.

属性标志**SHF_WRITE**说明当程序在运行时，该section的数据是可写的。

### SHF_ALLOC

The section occupies memory during process execution. Some control sections do not reside in the memory image of an object file; this attribute is off for those sections.

当一个section存在于程序最终的进程映像中，那么该section需要设置**SHF_ALLOC**标志。相反，有的section并不存在于程序的进程映像中，那么就不需要设置**SHF_ALLOC**。

### SHF_EXECINSTR

The section contains executable machine instructions.

当一个section设置了**SHF_EXECINSTR**标志，表明该section中存在可执行的机器指令。

### SHF_MERGE

The data in the section may be merged to eliminate duplication. Unless the SHF_STRINGS flag is also set, the data elements in the section are of a uniform size. The size of each element is specified in the section header's sh_entsize field. If the SHF_STRINGS flag is also set, the data elements consist of null-terminated character strings. The size of each character is specified in the section header's sh_entsize field.
Each element in the section is compared against other elements in sections with the same name, type and flags. Elements that would have identical values at program run-time may be merged. Relocations referencing elements of such sections must be resolved to the merged locations of the referenced values. Note that any relocatable values, including values that would result in run-time relocations, must be analyzed to determine whether the run-time values would actually be identical. An ABI-conforming object file may not depend on specific elements being merged, and an ABI-conforming link editor may choose not to merge specific elements.

### SHF_STRINGS

The data elements in the section consist of null-terminated character strings. The size of each character is specified in the section header's sh_entsize field.

### SHF_INFO_LINK

The sh_info field of this section header holds a section header table index.

### SHF_LINK_ORDER

This flag adds special ordering requirements for link editors. The requirements apply if the sh_link field of this section's header references another section (the linked-to section). If this section is combined with other sections in the output file, it must appear in the same relative order with respect to those sections, as the linked-to section appears with respect to sections the linked-to section is combined with.
