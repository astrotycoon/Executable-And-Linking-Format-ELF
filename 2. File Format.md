# File Format 文件格式
Object files participate in program linking (building a program) and program execution (running a program). For convenience and efficiency, the object file format provides parallel views of a file's contents, reflecting the differing needs of those activities. Figure 1-1 shows an object file's organization.

程序的链接和运行都需要ELF文件的参与。因此，为了方便和高效，ELF文件格式同时提供了这两个阶段需要的信息。图4-1是从两个不同的视角来看ELF文件格式，一个是链接时视角，一个是运行时视角。

An ELF header resides at the beginning and holds a ``road map'' describing the file's organization. Sections hold the bulk of object file information for the linking view: instructions, data, symbol table, relocation information, and so on. Descriptions of special sections appear later in the chapter. Chapter 5 discusses segments and the program execution view of the file.

A program header table tells the system how to create a process image. Files used to build a process image (execute a program) must have a program header table; relocatable files do not need one. A section header table contains information describing the file's sections. Every section has an entry in the table; each entry gives information such as the section name, the section size, and so on. Files used during linking must have a section header table; other object files may or may not have one.
