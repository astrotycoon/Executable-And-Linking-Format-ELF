# Sections

An object file's section header table lets one locate all the file's sections. The section header table is an array of Elf32_Shdr or Elf64_Shdr structures as described below. A section header table index is a subscript into this array. The ELF header's e_shoff member gives the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the section header table. e_shnum normally tells how many entries the section header table contains. e_shentsize gives the size in bytes of each entry.
