# [Intel386 Architecture Processor](http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/abi386-4.pdf)
## ELF Header
### Machine Information

For ﬁle identiﬁcation in `e_ident`, the Intel386 architecture requires the following values.

**Figure 4-1:  Intel386 Identiﬁcation, `e_ident`**

**Position**|  **Value**
|:-|:-|
`e_ident[EI_CLASS]` |**ELFCLASS32**
`e_ident[EI_DATA]`| **ELFDATA2LSB**

Processor identiﬁcation resides in the ELF header’s `e_machine` member and must have the value **EM_386**.

The ELF header’s `e_flags` member holds bit ﬂags associated with the ﬁle.  The Intel386 architecture deﬁnes no ﬂags; so this member contains zero.

# [AMD64 Architecture Processor](https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf)
## ELF Header
### Machine Information

For ﬁle identiﬁcation in `e_ident`, the AMD64 architecture requires the following values.

**Table 4.1: AMD64 Identiﬁcation**
**Position**|  **Value**
|:-|:-|
`e_ident[EI_CLASS]` |**ELFCLASS64**
`e_ident[EI_DATA]`| **ELFDATA2LSB**

Processor identiﬁcation resides in the ELF headers `e_machine` member and must have the value **EM_X86_64**（The value of this identiﬁer is 62）. 

### Number of Program Headers

The `e_phnum` member contains the number of entries in the program header table. The product of `e_phentsize` and `e_phnum` gives the table’s size in bytes. If a ﬁle has no program header table, `e_phnum` holds the value zero.

If the number of program headers is greater than or equal to **PN_XNUM** (0xffff), this member has the value **PN_XNUM** (0xffff). The actual number of program header table entries is contained in the `sh_info` ﬁeld of the section header at index **0**. Otherwise, the `sh_info` member of the initial entry contains the value zero.
