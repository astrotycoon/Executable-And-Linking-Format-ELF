# [Intel386 Architecture Processor](http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/abi386-4.pdf)
## ELF Header
### Machine Information

For ﬁle identiﬁcation in `e_ident`, the Intel386 architecture requires the following values.

**Figure 4-1:  Intel386 Identiﬁcation, `e_ident`**

**Position**|  **Value**
|:-|:-|
`e_ident[EI_CLASS]` |**ELFCLASS32**
`e_ident[EI_DATA]`| **ELFDATA2LSB**

Processor identiﬁcation resides in the ELF header’s `e_machine` member and must have the value **EM_386**.

The ELF header’s `e_flags` member holds bit ﬂags associated with the ﬁle.  The Intel386 architecture deﬁnes no ﬂags; so this member contains zero.

# [AMD64 Architecture Processor](https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf)
## ELF Header
### Machine Information

For ﬁle identiﬁcation in `e_ident`, the AMD64 architecture requires the following values.

**Table 4.1: AMD64 Identiﬁcation**
**Position**|  **Value**
|:-|:-|
`e_ident[EI_CLASS]` |**ELFCLASS64**
`e_ident[EI_DATA]`| **ELFDATA2LSB**

Processor identiﬁcation resides in the ELF headers `e_machine` member and must have the value **EM_X86_64**（The value of this identiﬁer is 62）. 

### Number of Program Headers

The `e_phnum` member contains the number of entries in the program header table. The product of `e_phentsize` and `e_phnum` gives the table’s size in bytes. If a ﬁle has no program header table, `e_phnum` holds the value zero.

If the number of program headers is greater than or equal to **PN_XNUM** (0xffff), this member has the value **PN_XNUM** (0xffff). The actual number of program header table entries is contained in the `sh_info` ﬁeld of the section header at index **0**. Otherwise, the `sh_info` member of the initial entry contains the value zero.

ELF Header
----------

The ELF header provides a number of fields that assist in interpretation of the
file.  Most of these are specified in the base standard.  The following fields
have Arm-specific meanings.

e_type
  There are currently no Arm-specific object file types.  All values between
  ``ET_LOPROC`` and ``ET_HIPROC`` are reserved to future revisions of this
  specification.

e_machine
  An object file conforming to this specification must have the value ``EM_ARM``
  (40, 0x28).

e_entry
  The value stored in this field is treated like any other code pointer.
  Specifically, if bit[0] is 0b1 then the entry point contains Thumb code;
  while bit[1:0] = 0b00 implies that the entry point contains Arm code.  The
  combination bit[1:0] = 0b10 is reserved.

  The base ELF specification requires this field to be zero if an application
  does not have an entry point.  Nonetheless, some applications may require an
  entry point of zero (for example, via the reset vector).

  A platform standard may specify that an executable file always has an entry
  point, in which case e_entry specifies that entry point, even if zero.

e_flags
  The processor-specific flags are shown in the following table. Unallocated
  bits, and bits allocated in previous versions of this specification, are
  reserved to future revisions of this specification.
